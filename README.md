## Introduction
This application python project come from https://github.com/DUT-Info-Montreuil/Mentorlib-SME and https://github.com/DUT-Info-Montreuil/Mentorlib-SApp

Orginally the backend was writted with flask and the frontend with sveltekit. Because is more simple to maintain only one project and use SSR
I decided to rewrite in Django (also I prefer Django ORM instead of Sqlalchemy :))

This application use tailwind & flowbite for components
